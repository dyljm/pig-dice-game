[Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29) is a simple dice game. The first player to score 100 wins!

## How to Play

Press the ***Roll Dice*** button to build your ***Current*** score. Once you're happy with it press ***Hold***. This will save your ***Current*** score to your overall score. Then it's the next players turn. 

If you roll a 1 your ***Current*** score is reset and the next player takes their turn. The first player to reach 100 wins.
